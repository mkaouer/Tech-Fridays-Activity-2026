## Part 1: Generate Your Website Content with Google Gemini

In this first part, you will use Google Gemini to analyze your resume and generate professional content for your portfolio website. Gemini is an AI assistant that excels at understanding documents and creating high-quality written content.

### Step 1.1: Access Google Gemini

Open your web browser and navigate to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com). Sign in with your Google account when prompted. Once signed in, you will see a chat interface where you can interact with Gemini.

### Step 1.2: Upload Your Resume

Look for the attachment icon (it looks like a paperclip or a plus sign) near the text input area. Click on it and select your resume file from your computer. Gemini can read PDF files, Word documents, and plain text files. After uploading, you should see your file attached to the conversation.

### Step 1.3: Generate Content for Each Section

Now you will ask Gemini to create content for the different sections of your portfolio website. Copy and paste each of the following prompts into Gemini, one at a time. After each response, copy the generated text into a separate document (like Google Docs or Notepad) so you can use it later.

**Prompt 1: About Me Section**

```
Based on my attached resume, write a professional "About Me" section for my portfolio website. 
The section should be 2-3 paragraphs long, written in first person, and should:
- Introduce who I am
- Highlight my passion for technology and learning
- Mention my key strengths and interests
- Be engaging and suitable for a high school student's portfolio
```
